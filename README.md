# Library-Project-Python
3 classes called Library, Borrower and Book. Each class has a bunch of its own different methods. Created a library with 20 books and 10 borrowers (users).  We have used the method lend_book in order for a borrower(user) to borrow a book from the library. We use the method return_book to return a book to the library.
